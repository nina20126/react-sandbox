## About

This project is a collection of smaller React applications. Here starts my journey to learning React and best way to learn is to start creating. This is my place to test and explore! Next project will be something with more sense while this is just a sandbox. 

### What have I learned? 

#### 1. React + Vite

This project is created using React + Vite and JavaScript / JSX.  I have also basic understanding about the earlier habit creating React Apps (using create react-app command) but I wanted to learn the new way of doing things.

#### 2. Navigation

Navigation is created by using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main). BrowserRouter is used here because this is a web app. Links are wrapped inside nav elements and Link element points the address. After that routing is created using Routes and Route points to the right application page.

#### 3. Counter

This application takes record when user press the buttons. User can add one, reduse one or reset the calculator bact to zero. There is also a button witch sets a random color to the header.

#### 4. API calls

Pages Nasa and People use API calls to get their information. Nasa's APOD API fetch astrological image or video and description for that. Content changes every day. The list in people page and all the information, including images, are from fake api. Information is presented in a table. 

#### 5. Creating editable list that uses Firebase as NoSQL database

<img src="https://github.com/nina20126/react-sandbox/assets/77397102/4e79845c-c5b6-4ebd-ae34-ec869833bd64" alt="Book page present an editable list" width="600" />

Books page present a list where user can add books to read or remove them from the list. The data is saved in [Google's Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) database and the application is styled with [MUI library](https://mui.com/).

#### 6. Publishing with GitHub pages
